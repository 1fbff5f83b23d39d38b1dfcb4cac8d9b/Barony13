# This file contains filters for spellchecking in supported speech systems, similar to config/pretty_filter.txt
# Each line contains one pattern and one replacement. The patterns used are regular expression patterns.
# If you don't know what those are, then please ask someone who does before you try editing this.
#
# Examples:
# 
# fuck=duck
#     This would replace all instances of "fuck" with duck. So "fucking" would become "ducking".
#
# fu+ck=duck
#    This would do the same as above, except it would accept one or more "u". So "fuuuuuck" would become "duck".
#
# Activate the ([\\S]+?)=use $1
#    This would match a group, and use it in a pattern. So "Activate the probulator" would become "use probulator".
# 
# \\b[f]+[u]+\\b=fun you
#    This would make any word with combinations of "f" followed by "u" be replaced with fun you. So "ffffffffuuuuuuuuuuu" becomes "fun you".
