# The Rules


## Core Rules
0.0: Don’t be a fucking dick. Don't behave in a manner that goes out of its way to deprive the enjoyment of others. These rules are not an exhaustive list. Rules-lawyering is strongly discouraged. If an admin asks you to knock something off, 'well it's not in the rules' is not really an argument. The staff team maintains the right to arbitrarily remove people that are a clear detriment to the community as a whole.

0.1: Do not be a bigot. This is not /b/ or your Klan leader's SS13 server. Do not use terminology that is considered bigoted or racist, or is offensive to a large group of people. Usage of the words “nigger”, “faggot”, and derivatives of those are completely banned from the server. Don't be a lowRP piece of shit and call things gay in IC comms.

0.2: Erotic content is forbidden. As a general rule, anything more sexualized than kissing and hugging is considered erotic. Do not roleplay acts of an erotic nature. Do not write, upload, or distribute pornographic literature.

0.3: Do not mix IC (in character) and OOC (out of character) knowledge. Do not post information related to a round in progress in the OOC chat. A person reading the OOC chat should not be able to know what's happening in a round, whether anyone is dead, etc. Do not use information your character would have no way of knowing in game. We have a zero-tolerance policy on this, it doesn’t matter how small or insignificant you think it is. Avoid using OOC terminology in character, but if it is necessary, use LOOC.

0.4: Do not metacommunicate or multikey. You are only allowed to participate on this server on a single BYOND account. Do not try to join with a different account to continue playing. Only use in-game means of communication to discuss in-game events.

0.5: Do not spam or advertise.

0.6: Use proper IC language. We are an English speaking community. Using any language other than English in either IC or OOC will be treated as metacommunications, as our admins cannot translate all languages. Do not use netspeak, emoticons, or internet memes in vocal IC communication.

0.7: Listen to admins. Everything is subject to admin discretion. If you cannot be contacted, you may be banned and have you explain your part of the story on the forums. Ignoring admin PMs, lying, insulting admins or other players, or showing a general bad attitude will be counted against you and will lead to a ban.

0.8: Do not abuse bugs.
