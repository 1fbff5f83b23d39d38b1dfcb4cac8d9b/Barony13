# The Rules
Hi. Thanks a lot for reading these.

The **TL;DR** of this whole sheet is that ultimately, as long as you follow the big rule 0.0, and all the core rules surrounding it, you should pretty much never get into trouble. That being said, the admins will still enforce all of these rules as they are written here, so knowing what they are is likely a very good idea.

These rules are generally ordered by priority, with lower-number rules being more important and having harder punishments.
## Core Rules
These apply to the Github, Discord, and Server.

### 0.0: Don’t be a fucking dick. Don't behave in a manner that goes out of its way to deprive the enjoyment of others. These rules are not an exhaustive list. Rules-lawyering is strongly discouraged. If an admin asks you to knock something off, 'well it's not in the rules' is not an argument. The staff team maintains the right to arbitrarily remove people that are a clear detriment to the community as a whole.

**0.1: Do not be a bigot.** This is not /b/ or your Klan leader's SS13 server. Do not use terminology that is considered bigoted or racist, or is offensive to a large group of people. Usage of the words “nigger”, “faggot”, and derivatives of those are completely banned from the server. Don't be a lowRP piece of shit and call things gay in IC comms.

**0.2: Listen to admins.** Everything is subject to admin discretion. If you cannot be contacted, you may be banned and have you explain your part of the story on the forums. Ignoring admin PMs, lying, insulting admins or other players, or showing a general bad attitude will be counted against you and will lead to a ban.

**0.3: Erotic content is forbidden.** As a general rule, anything more sexualized than kissing and hugging is considered erotic. Do not roleplay acts of an erotic nature. Do not write, upload, or distribute pornographic literature.

**0.4: Do not metacommunicate or multikey.** You are only allowed to participate on this server on a single BYOND account. Do not try to join with a different account to continue playing. Only use in-game means of communication to discuss in-game events.

**0.5: Do not abuse bugs.** If you see a bug, report it [here](https://github.com/morrowwolf/Barony13/issues).

**0.6: Do not mix IC (in character) and OOC (out of character) knowledge.** Do not post information related to a round in progress in the OOC chat or anywhere on the Github or Discord. A person reading the OOC chat should not be able to know what's happening in a round, whether anyone is dead, etc. Do not use information your character would have no way of knowing in game. We have a zero-tolerance policy on this. Avoid using OOC terminology in character, but if it is necessary, use LOOC.

**0.7: Do not spam or advertise.**

**0.8: Speak American.** We are primarily an English speaking community. Speaking in languages the admins do not understand in either IC or OOC can be treated as metacommunications. If there are no admins present, you may only speak in English.


## Server Rules

**1.0: Keep the game fun.** This is the golden rule of the server. The admins have the right and responsibility to let you break the rules in this section when you are doing something fun, and fully enforce them when you are not. Act maliciously at your own peril. If you're worried something you're about to do might result in punishment, press F1 and adminhelp to ask if you can do it.

**1.1: Do not murderbone when not an antagonist.** When non-antag, engage in murder and aggravated assault at your own peril. If admins deem your killings to be unfun, you will be punished.

**1.2: Do not metagame.** Your character does not know everything you do. If you die and return as a new character, act as a new character. Do not use knowledge you learned in previous lives.

**1.3: Do not use netspeak,** emoticons, or internet memes in vocal IC communication.

**1.4: Use a realistic name.** Human characters should have at least a first and last name. Obscene names or names that are similar in look or pronunciation to obscene phrases are forbidden. Avoid using famous names or names of other fictional characters. Do not include honorifics in your name. Some roles may be exempt from this rule; contact your local admin for more information.

**1.5: Pick roles that you actually intend to play.**  Do not repeatedly commit suicide at roundstart when playing any job with limited slots. Peasants are exempt from this rule.

### Antagonist Rules
Remember that the all rules above still apply when you are an Antagonist.

**1.1.0: Be active.** Do not hide in a closet somewhere for the entire game. If you have to leave the game, adminhelp so we can replace you and keep the game going.

**1.1.1: Don't teamkill when part of a team,** such as when you are skeleton serving a Witch. "Lone wolf" antagonists do not need to follow this rule.

## Discord Rules

**2.0: Keep discussion where it should be.** Keep your discussion related to the topic of the channel you're talking in. Keep degenerate or otherwise vaguely-NSFW discussion in `#off-topic` and `#memes`.
