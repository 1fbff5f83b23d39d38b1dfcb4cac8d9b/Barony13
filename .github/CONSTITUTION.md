# Constitution of the Barony

## Introduction
This is a reference for how the staff of the Barony are structured, how the ranks work, how to become this or that rank, etc.

What's written here is not the consitution of an actual nation-state, so don't feel like it's completely set it stone or impossible to alter. Feel free to make PRs suggesting changes to it.


## The Host Department
The hosts have full control over the server, Discord, and Github, and have final say on all matters. All powers vested into everyone else may be dissolved at will by these two people, if absolutely necessary.

All head ranks are given through the mutual approval of these two people. There is no set process for this; ask one of these people if you are interested in taking on a vacant head role.

The hosts must each make a minimum of one Pull Request per month.

### Host: *MorrowWolf*

### Co-host: *Altoids*


## The Admin Department
The admins handle DMing the game and enforcing the rules. Applications for admin ranks (when open) can be done on the Github here: https://github.com/morrowwolf/Barony13/issues , and are handled by either the Head Admin or the hosts.

### Head Admin: *DLCabbose*
The **Head Admin** has full control over not only who is given administration ranks. He also controls how the rules are to be interpreted, and can override the discretion of all admins below him, as well as any administrative actions taken by members of other departments.

## The Design Department

### Head Designer: *Parune*
The **Head Designer** has full control over all decisions regarding art (sprites, music, etc) added to the game. He also is a major participant in discussions on the general game design.

## The Development Department
The most important department. Applications for dev ranks (when open) can be done on the Github here: https://github.com/morrowwolf/Barony13/issues , and are handled by either the Head Developer or the hosts.

### Head Developer
The **Head Developer** has full control over the Github, and has host-level authority on all matters related to the Github.

Head Developers must make a minimum of 3 Pull Requests per month.

### Senior Developer
**Senior Developers** have all the permissions of Developers, as well as an ability to merge PRs (provided they do not merge their own).

Senior Developers must make a minimum of 3 Pull Requests per month.

### Developer
Earning the rank of developer grants the user donor permissions, access to the #staff channel, and a much greater say on Github matters.

Developers must make a minimum of one Pull Request per month.


### Freelancers
Freelancers are people who have somehow contributed or shown a desire to contribute *something* to the repository. They may participate in staff meetings if they want, and have greater say in how the server is operated than the regular player.
